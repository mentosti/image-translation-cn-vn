# Image Translation from CN to VN - Chrome Extension

### Description:
This is a Chrome extension helps recognize Chinese text in images and translate it to Vietnamese language.

### Usage:

### Story behind:
I love reading comic on Web especially manhua (Chinese comic). However, I don't understand Chinese language and the most important thing is the translation progress is too slow and cannot satisfy my curiosity of upcoming stories. Additionally, some translators could have busy time at some point and delay translating or even stop translating comics.

In the old days, I myself found out that a possible best solution was to use Google Translate with camera mode on mobile phone to take each picture of a block of text and get respective translated text. Meaning that for each 1 of block of Chinese text I have to take 1 picture. Moreover, 1 chapter has plenty of pictures in it so I have to do the job again and again. Crazy, isn't it?

Therefore, I decided to make this tool to not only `quickly` translate Chinese to Vietnamese but also with `high accuracy` thanks to dichtienghoa.com.

### Using Google Cloud Vision API (Optical Character Recognition) and Chinese-Vietnamese Translation API of dichtienghoa.com
